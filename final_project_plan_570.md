## üèÅ Final Project Plan ‚Äì Machine Learning Driving Function

**Deadline:** First Week of June
**Group:** 1

---

### üöò Driving Function Description

The system must include a **behavioral cloning** component.

To increase robustness, a **secondary backup approach** should also be implemented ‚Äî this can be:

* an additional **sensor modality** (e.g., IMU, LiDAR, ultrasonic), or
* a complementary **technique**, such as classical object detection (e.g., using YOLO) or rule-based logic.

> üí° *Remember:* Implementing a **DAgger approach** (Dataset Aggregation) can also be a great standalone project ‚Äî especially if you're interested in improving your model by continuously collecting corrections from an expert during deployment.

**Questions to address:**

* What should the system do?

_The system will complete the course as intended but if another car is detected 
ahead, a constant following distance will be maintained. Car detection will be 
acheived using YOLO._

* What criteria define the task as successfully completed?

### üìä Top-Level System Flow

* **Diagram:** Add a top-level flowchart showing all ROS2 nodes, and the topics they subscribe to and publish.
  *(Insert image here)*
* **Description:**

  * Explain the reasoning behind your architecture.
  * Is the system modular and failsafe?
  * What happens in case of failure of one node?

### ‚öôÔ∏è Node-Level Flow & Data Handling

* **Diagram:** Add a node-level flowchart showing the internal logic of your main nodes.
  *(Insert image here)*
* **Description:**

  * Explain the flow of data within your callbacks.
  * What transformations or decisions are made inside each function?
  * How are outputs published or stored?

### üß† Model Architecture

You must run **multiple training tests**. Ideally, each team member should run one experiment to:

* distribute the workload evenly
* share the available GPU resources on Colab efficiently

**Hyperparameter tuning is essential** ‚Äî make sure to:

* test different learning rates
* test different dropout rates
* experiment with different batch sizes
* extend your dataset if possible
* be cautious with augmentation ‚Äî apply only light effects (e.g., slight blur)

All trainings must be **tracked and compared using wandb.ai** to ensure consistency.

**Describe the following:**

* What model architecture(s) are you planning to test?
  Examples include:

  * **Steering angle regression**
  * **Speed prediction (regression)**
  * **Classification of steering and/or speed into bins**
  * **Steering prediction with temporal horizon** (e.g., predicting future steering over time)

* Who is responsible for each model implementation and training run?

### üé• Data Requirements

* What data or bagfiles do you need?
* How should the recording setup look like?
* List required topics to be recorded.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Strategy

* How will you approach the implementation step-by-step?
* Which environments do you use (e.g., Colab, ROS2 simulation, real vehicle)?
* Do you plan to:

  * Load and inspect data in notebooks?
  * Develop and debug nodes in simulation first?
  * Avoid testing unproven code directly on the vehicle?
* What is your plan for debugging and validating your solution?
